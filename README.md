# Purpose

Sharks & Tigers is an adaptation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Each player takes a turn to mark the board until they get three of their marks in row. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins!

# Gameplay

A game is always started by player one. Player one will start a game and then the game will be available on the game market for a seccond player to join. Each game has an ID that can be shared for another player to join. Player one starts the game with a first move, and this leaves a diverse marketplace of open games that have a known first move. Player one also begins each game with a wager that must be matched by player two when joining the game.
